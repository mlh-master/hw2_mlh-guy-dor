Relevant patient features for the algorithm may include blood pressure (BP), body-mass index (BMI), age (A), level of physical activity (P), and income (I). You should choose between two classifiers: the first uses only BP and BMI features and the other one uses all of the features available to you. Explain the pros and cons of each choice."

She has already come up with dozens of measurements to take, such as color, size, uniformity and cell-count, but she isnâ€™t sure which model to use. The biopsies are really similar, and it is difficult to distinguish them from the human eye, or by just looking at the features. Which of the following is better: logistic regression, linear SVM or nonlinear SVM? Explain your answer."
